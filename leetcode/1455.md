# 1455. Check If a Word Occurs As a Prefix of Any Word ni a Sentence

Given a `sentence` that consists of some words separated by a *single space*, and `searchWord`, check if `searchWord` is a prefix of any word in `sentence`.

Return *the index of the word in `sentence`* (**1-indexed**) where `searchWord` is a prefix of this word. If `searchWord` is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word (**minimum index**). If there is no such word return `-1`.

A **prefix** of a string `s` is any leading contiguous substring of `s`.

## Using Index
It is clear that this problem is easily solved by leveraging high-level datastructures like vector of strings. However, I want to solve this by only manipulating indexes.

```c++
int isPrefixOfWord(string sentence, string searchWord) {
    // we keep two pointers - one for index of sentence, si, and the other for index of searchWrod, needle.
    // we also keep track of how many words there are in the sentence. to do this, we can simply use how many spaces have passed.
    int needle = 0, si = 0, passed = 0;

    // we have two obvious invariants: both indexes should be in their valid range.
    while (si < sentence.size()) {
        // skip while it meets valid prefix condition and invariants.
        while (needle < searchWord.size() && si < sentence.size() &&
            sentence[si] == searchWord[needle]) {
            needle++;
            si++;
        }

        // check whether it was valid prefix
        if (needle == searchWord.size()) {
            return passed + 1;
        }

        // prepare to the next candidate
        passed++;
        needle = 0;
        while (si < sentence.size() && sentence[si] != ' ') {
            si++;
        }

        // forward once to the start point of the next word
        si++;
    }
    // not found
    return -1;
}
```
